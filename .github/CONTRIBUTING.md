NB: This guide is being actively updated so if there could be details missing or out of date. In most cases, I'll annotate incomplete sections with a '_wip_' phrase.

# How Can I Contribute
The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Slim Launcher. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request. If this looks familiar, that's because I copied it from [Atom's contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
